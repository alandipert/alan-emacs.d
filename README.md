### The Goods

* Clojure stuff
* Latest `org-mode`
* Latest `magit`
* Sweet color theme I'm working on, `color-theme-miami-vice`, based on `color-theme-molokai`

### Prepare

* Emacs 23.2+, GUI or CLI, on Mac or Linux
* texinfo (to build magit): on Ubuntu, install with `sudo apt-get install texinfo`

### Install

1. Clone this repository move it to `~/.emacs.d`
2. Run Emacs.  When you see the message "Congrats, el-get is installed and ready to serve!", restart Emacs.
4. Emacs will do more stuff and then stop. You might see a warning.  Restart Emacs again.
5. More crazy stuff will happen.  Restart Emacs again.
6. Done!
